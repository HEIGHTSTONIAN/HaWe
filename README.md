What was once the difficult choice between using a notebook, legal pad, a stack of Post-it notes or a dozen of to-do apps to manage your personal to-do list is now the really simple choice - ![hawe](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28790452/31577131-9d82d6d2-b0ce-11e7-8553-c5485eeff890.png)
.
Managing tasks in the HaWe is more efficient, more powerful, and simply a better way to be more productive than doing it on paper.

 is easy to use and has a deep thematic in styling.
Our app gives you a range of tools for organizing your tasks.
Everyone likes competitions. ![hawe](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28790452/31577131-9d82d6d2-b0ce-11e7-8553-c5485eeff890.png)
 allows you to collect badges while you do you planned tasks.

## How it works
![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28790452/31577395-0cc32674-b0d3-11e7-9be4-2258616ec89c.gif)

Our app has user-friendly navigation. User can quickly navigate between 3 sections - App, About and Team.

For our sign in/ sign up logic, we used Passport.js

Passport is authentication middleware for Node.js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped into any Express-based web application.

Also we added a validation to help users to sign up correctly.

When the user logged in the app allows the user to create a to-do list, marked tasks as "Done" and delete tasks.

When you are done with every 5 tasks you will earn a badge.
