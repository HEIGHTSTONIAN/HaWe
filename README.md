What was once the difficult choice between using a notebook, legal pad, a stack of Post-it notes or a dozen of to-do apps to manage your personal to-do list is now the really simple choice - **HaWe**.
Managing tasks in the HaWe is more efficient, more powerful, and simply a better way to be more productive than doing it on paper.

**HaWe** is easy to use and has a deep thematic in styling.
Our app gives you a range of tools for organizing your tasks.
Everyone likes competitions. **HaWe** allows you to collect badges while you do you planned tasks.
